    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a person floating in a pool. How many magnets would they need in order \n",
    "to begin pointing north in the pool?\n",
    "\n",
    "(Drawing pending)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution\n",
    "To simplify things, we will model the person as a single magnet , suspended in \n",
    "the pool with the thin end pointed towards the sky, and rotating about its \n",
    "middle. (Pretend they're wearing a metal suit that we have somehow turned into a giant magnet.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotational version of Newton's second law is\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Sigma$ $\\tau$ = I $\\ddot{\\theta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    " \n",
    "* $\\tau$ represents the rotational forces on the object, \n",
    "* I represents the moment of inertia of the object about its rotational axis\n",
    "* $\\ddot{\\theta}$ represents the angular acceleration of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two rotational torques acting on the person would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) the magnetic force spinning the person north, which is given by [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "$mB\\sin(\\theta)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "* $\\theta$ represents the angle between the person's orientation and north\n",
    "* m represents the magnetic moment of the person\n",
    "* B represents the strength of the Earth's magnetic field \n",
    "\n",
    "2) the drag force acting on the person (which varies about their rotational centre)\n",
    "For an individual part of the person $\\ dx$ a distance from the rotational centre $\\ x$, the drag torque can be represented by \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ x F_d$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\rho A C_d V^2}{2}\\ dx$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ V$, at distance $\\ x$ from the rotational centre, is given by $\\ x \\dot{\\theta}$, where $\\dot{\\theta}$ is the rotational velocity in radians/sec.\n",
    "$\\ rho$ represents the density of the water\n",
    "$\\ A$ represents the cross sectional area at that location, which is given by $\\ h \\ dx$, where $\\ h$ represents the height of the person in the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting these all together we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{x^3 \\rho h C_d \\dot{\\theta^2}}{2} \\ dx$\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating from the center of the person to the edge of the person, over a distance r, you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\int_{0}^{r}\\frac{x^3 \\rho h C_d \\dot{\\theta^2}}{2} \\ dx = \\frac{r^4 \\rho h C_d \\dot{\\theta^2}}{8} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as r is equal to the half the height of the person $\\frac{H}{2}$ we can write the drag force as \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{H^4 \\rho h C_d \\dot{\\theta^2}}{128} $\n",
    "\n",
    "and the entire equation now becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{-H^4 \\rho h C_d \\dot{\\theta^2}}{128} + mB\\sin(\\theta) = I \\ddot{\\theta}$\n",
    "\n",
