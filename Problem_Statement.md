# Problem Statement

Imagine a person floating in a pool. How many magnets would they need in order 
to begin pointing north in the pool?

(Drawing pending)

# Solution
To simplify things, we will model the person as a single magnet , suspended in 
the pool with the thin end pointed towards the sky, and rotating about its 
middle.

The rotational version of Newton's second law is

$\Sigma$ $\tau$ = I $\ddot{\theta}$

where
 
* $\tau$ represents the rotational forces on the object, 
* I represents the moment of inertia of the object about its rotational axis
* $\ddot{\theta}$ represents the angular acceleration of the object.
