This repo is about solving a nonlinear ode problem proposed by a friend of the author. 

Problem idea from a friend, original C code from http://physics.oregonstate.edu/~landaur/nacphy/ComPhys/DIFFEQ/PRO/rk_c/rk_c.html
(Rubin Landau OSU)

Repository name is for the fact the original code was tested using the Termux application on a Canadian Samsung S5 phone.
